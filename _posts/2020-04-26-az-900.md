Last April 10, I took the AZ-900 examination, the certification for Azure Fundamentals. And thankfully I passed it despite technical difficulties. I took the exam via Pearson Vue, an online proctored exam, as it is the recommended method of taking the exam due to COVID-19 situation. 

<br>
Quick Tips:
1. Read all exam tips from the Microsoft Learn site.
2. Learn by heart the concepts of Cloud technology and Azure services.
3. Be early checking in the actual exam. Exam will open 30 minutes before the actual time.
4. Always check your network before taking the exam, use LAN if possible.
5. If unsure with the answer, mark it for review.
6. Manage your time well.
7. If you run into problems, ask for assistance by talking to the camera because the proctor is always watching.

Good luck!
