I passed the AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals certification exam!

Last April 10, I took the AZ-900 examination, the certification for Azure Fundamentals. And thankfully I passed it despite technical difficulties. I took the exam via an online protoctored test via Pearson Vue as it is the recommended method of taking the exam due to COVID-19 situation.

  1. Learn the basics of cloud technoligies
  2. Learn the basic services of Azure
  3.
