Oh yes, I already cleared AZ-301, the examination for Azure Architect Design! And it was a tough one!

<br>

The exam's scope is obviously on the designing side of Azure architecture. So expect a lot of things like decisions on VM provisioning, VNet management, core services, cost, etc. 
And of course, anticipate tricky and confusing questions.

<br>

You might have searched for exam tips over the internet, but here's a little list of things that helped me.

<br>

What worked for me:
1. My main resource is the series in A Cloud Guru by Nick Colyer.
2. I have focused on situations where services should be utilized.
3. On the actual exam, I read the question statement first before reading the given as scenarios are lenghty. Typically, questions are found in the later part of the scenario.
4. For use cases, again, they are lengthy, so I read the question first. Then go back to the use case to locate the given scenario.
5. A lot of questions have possible correct answers, but choose what's best. A very notable hint, as an example, is the given "at minimum cost".

<br>
Now that I have passed AZ-301, my next goal is AZ-300, the examination for Azure Architect Technologies, the partner exam to earn the Azure Architect Expert Certification.
